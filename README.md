# Rock Paper Scissors Game

# Description
A Project which HTML, CSS and JavaScript is used to design to a game called as Rock Paper Scissors.
Its a game in the web-page in which the user has to select either one of these "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" using one of the three buttons each corresponding to its text. It is expected to display the winner when either Computer or the Player reaches a score of 5.

## Changes in with UI : 

- Every round the score is updated and the result of that round is displayed on the screen.
- When the winner is announced the score gets reset and you get the result by an alert.

## Implementation:

- The user input is made through interaction with buttons that use the script of adding **EventListener**  on every click.
- The score updating and each round winner is displayed using the **DOM manipulation technique**.
- The winner is announced through the same **alert()** function.
